Then we are faced with the primary page, showing all the listings as well as detailed information below, and tabs above for different sections

After clicking on the title of an auction, we are taken to its page where a logged in user can bid, comment, and add it to their watchlist. If the user is the owner of the listing, they have the option of closing it as well.

Then we have the create listing menu, where a user may add a new listing to the database

Once added, it shows up in the main page along with the other listings

Moving on to the watchlist, I watchlisted the banana from earlier so only it shows up on this page

The closed listings tab shows us all of the listings that were closed, who won, and at what price

Finally, the sort by category tab allows us to filter listings by their category
